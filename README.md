# Theoretical GIS Research Framework

## Project Overview

This repository explores the theoretical foundations of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and develops a novel spatial modeling framework that extends traditional GIS assumptions. The project is structured in three progressive phases, moving from foundational theory to mathematical formalization and finally to a proposed research contribution.

## Phase 1 – Foundations

This phase establishes the conceptual and structural basis of GIS. It focuses on:

- Spatial data models (Vector and Raster)
- Topological relationships (adjacency, connectivity, containment)
- Coordinate Reference Systems and projections
- Spatial autocorrelation principles
- Core assumptions underlying spatial analysis

The objective of this phase is to build rigorous theoretical clarity about how geographic space is represented and analyzed computationally.

## Phase 2 – Mathematical GIS

This phase formalizes GIS concepts using mathematical structures. It includes:

- Graph-based spatial representations (G = V, E)
- Spatial weight matrices
- Distance and impedance functions
- Formal topology definitions
- Spatial autocorrelation metrics (e.g., Moran’s I)

The goal is to transition from descriptive GIS understanding to analytical and mathematical abstraction.

## Phase 3 – Novel Framework Development

This phase proposes a theoretical extension to traditional GIS models.

The core research direction explores the limitations of static, distance-based spatial analysis and introduces a behavior-weighted spatial impedance formulation. The proposed framework integrates geographic distance with behavioral and socio-economic resistance variables to model spatial accessibility more realistically.

This phase includes:

- Problem definition and research gap
- Limitations of current GIS modeling approaches
- Mathematical formulation of the proposed framework
- Conceptual use-case scenarios

## Research Objective

To move beyond purely geometric representations of space and introduce a theoretically grounded extension that incorporates behavioral and contextual friction into spatial interaction modeling.
